## Tools
The tools that came with your Kossel Pro will get you most of the way.  You'll also need to buy or borrow some specialized tools for terminating the wires for the new connections:

- [Ferrule Crimper with Ferrules](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K160CC8/)
- [Ratcheting crimp pliers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1213)
- [Wire stripper](https://www.amazon.com/IRWIN-VISE-GRIP-Self-Adjusting-Stripper-2078300)

A 2.5mm drill and an M3 tap are also recommended for forming threads in the plastic parts.

## Print the parts

## Strip the printer
Unplug power first and let it sit a few minutes at least.

To ease disassebly, you can cut the power input and heated bed output wires right at the Brainwave Pro motherboard.  We will
re-use these wires with new ends on them during assembly.

Disassembly:
  Remove end effector
  Remove delta arms
  Remove print glass & heated bed
  Remove bed clamp assemblies
  Remove power inlet/switch bulkhead and wires to the PSU
  Disconnect all wires and remove Brainwave Pro mainboard
  Remove extruder cold end assembly

If you didn't add the extra m3 nuts to the lower frame rails as recommended in the assembly guide, then you'll need to go back now and add them.  This is an exercise left to the reader, but turning the printer upside down and removing one rail at a time can be helpful.
