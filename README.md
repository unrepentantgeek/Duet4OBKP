Duet Wifi upgrades for the OpenBeam Kossel Pro

## Introduction
This is a set of 3D printed parts and instructions to upgrade the OpenBeam Kossel Pro to use the Duet Wifi (or Duet Ethernet) electronics.  The parts may also fit other printers that share similar geometry.

## The basics
The basic upgrade requires only the Duet motherboard and a 30mm fan, plus two printed parts for mounting and protecting the electronics.

  * 30mm 5V fan
  * [Panel mount USB cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/937) (optional)


## Touchscreen
The PanelDue controller and touchscreen give you front panel monitoring and access to most of the functions of the printer.  It is available in 3 screen sizes, and printed enclosures are available for each.  Note that the 7" display enclosure is very large and may require removal of two bed clamps to be printable on the Kossel Pro.

## Hotend
The E3D hotend is one of the best, and the E3D lite is an amazing value.  With a couple of printed parts the end effector can be upgraded to fit either one.  Just make sure that you get the 24v heater to match the Kossel Pro's power supply.  You will also need to obtain another 5v 30mm fan (4.3CFM) as the Kossel Pro end effector cannot handle 24v.

  * 30mm 5v fan (4.3CFM)

## Streaming webcam
You can mount a Raspberry Pi Zero W in the offical case with a camera and cheap wide angle lens to get streaming video in the web interface of your printer.

## PEI/Ultem print surface
This is an inexpensive and highly recommended upgrade for improved bed adhesion.
